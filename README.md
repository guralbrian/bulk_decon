## Project Summary

This project is meant to measure the degree of cardiac cellular remodeling that occurs in C57BL/6 mice during heart failure, and how those compositional changes mediate bulk gene expression changes. Additionally, through a cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out model, we define the cardioprotective effect of the α1-adrenergic receptors. 

Prior research has established the role of α1-AR  [in cardiac mitocondrial function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35170492/) and [postinfarct remodeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X23004187)

All data collection was performed in the labs of Drs. Brian Jensen, Christoph Rau, and Mikayla Patterson.
