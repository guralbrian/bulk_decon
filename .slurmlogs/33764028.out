Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files.
Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/proj/raulab/users/brian/r_projects/bulk_decon/.snakemake/tmp.ky_pgc_n
touch: cannot touch '/proj/raulab/users/brian/r_projects/bulk_decon/.snakemake/tmp.ky_pgc_n/13.jobfailed': No such file or directory
