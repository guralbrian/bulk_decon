MissingOutputException in line 12 of /proj/raulab/users/brian/r_projects/bulk_decon/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 30 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
